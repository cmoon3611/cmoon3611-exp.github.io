      <h2>Hi, I'm Chris.</h2>
        <p>I am a current sophomore at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am studying Finance and Accounting and hope to pursue a career in sales & trading or venture capital. In my free time, I like to work out, listen to music, play Smash Bros. with my friends, and generally have a good time.</p>
        <p>On campus, I am currently the President of Smith Finance Group. I am also one of the Social Chairs for Alpha Kappa Psi Business Fraternity, a member of the Smith Business Leadership Fellows, and a member of the 42nd Cohort of the Quest Honors Program. Additionally, I am a member of the University Honors Program, a Financials Associate for Smith Equity Research Club, and a new member of the WallStreet Fellows Program in the Smith School.</p>
